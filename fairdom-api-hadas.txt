Subject: Re: Api Testing
 
Hello Andrej, 
 
Sorry this has taken a while. A combination of strikes, vacations and sick-leaves basically delayed the entire process. 
 
It is now possible to start testing the SEEK API at: (create yourself a user if you don’t already have one) 
https://testing.sysmo-db.org/
 
Documentation can be found here: 
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/FAIRDOM/SEEK/0.2
 
I have uploaded an example of using the writeAPI here: 
https://github.com/hleonov/ipython_for_SEEK-API
 
Please let me know if you have any questions, bugs to report, or any other general feedback,
All the best,
Hadas
